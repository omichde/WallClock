# WallClock

This is a small tvOS clock application with a timer. It has an analog clock and an LED clock.

If you press the play/pause button, a 15 minute timer will start/end.
The timer is indicated by a colored slice in the background of the analog clock.
While the time passes, the color of the slice will change from green to red.

The analog and the LED clock are driven by PaintCode and its parametric drawing methods.
